    <h3 class="pp-title">About the Project</h3>
    <p class="pp-body-copy">The goal of the project was to create a mobile app that would relieve the pain points of a user story. In this case, the user story revolved around a cyclist in a busy city who was concerned for their safety while biking through the chaotic city streets everyday, to and from work. The concerns included construction zones, other cars on the road, and general bike safety. The best way to keep a cyclist safe? Nowadays, everyone has a phone on them 24/7, so why not use your phone to keep you safe? With a combination of the app installed on a phone, and a not-yet-available attachment for your helmet that would give the app a 360 degree view of everything around you, the app would be able to send you a notification on your phone whenever a safety concern arises. For example, if a car was getting a little too close to a cyclist, the phone would send a notification that would be read aloud so the user wouldn't have to take their eyes off the road to read the message.</p>
