    <h3 class="pp-title">The Goal</h3>
    <p class="pp-body-copy">The goal of this project was to create a layout that could be consistently used across four articles that are of different topics: fashion, technology, fitness &amp; world news.</p>

    <h3 class="pp-title">The Idea</h3>
    <p class="pp-body-copy">The inspiration for this design layout came from the New York City based fashion magazine, Nylon. Nylon has more of a cluttered look than I felt would look best for the variety of topics covered in this project. I wanted to make it far more simple since the topics were so broad. I decided to go with clean white pages, with large titles, pull quotes &amp; page numbers. To keep the articles organized, the best choice was to go with colour-coaded sections. I decided to keep the body copy with a large, bold sans-serif for readability while keeping with the modern look of the design.</p>

    <h3 class="pp-title">The Process</h3>
    <p class="pp-body-copy">To successfully create this design, I referenced Nylon Magazine, while adding my own spin on the look of the layouts, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign and a Macbook Pro, the magazine quickly came together with hardwork and dedication.</p>
