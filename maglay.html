    <h3 class="pp-title">About The Project</h3>
    <p class="pp-body-copy">The objective of this project was to create an editorial design for an article that was a minimum of 4000 words, without any single spread being strictly body copy. For this project, I had incorporated large, bold imagery alongside drastic pull quotes in a strong serif typeface to create drama within the piece. Anyone who has listened to Lorde, or even seen her, could tell that she is a dark, but dramatic person, both in every day life, and her in artistry. When selecting typefaces, I chose to go with Baskerville STD at a 9pt size. Baskerville was a very obvious choice for this article as it had a wide enough variety in its family that I could select different weights for the interviewer and for Lorde herself.</p>
