    <h3 class="pp-title">About the Project</h3>
    <p class="pp-body-copy">The plan for this project was to create an editorial design that could be consistently used across four articles that all widely varied in topic. To do this, I began looking for inspiration and looked to a more modern and different magazine that I often look to â€“ Nylon Magazine. Nylon is based out of New York City, and has a very urban and modern look to it, using entirely sans serif fonts, bold titles, colourful photography and sketch-like illustration styles, I wanted to create a magazine that was inspired by this, but with my own twist. I kept with the bold, strong titles and sans serif typeface to honour the magazine, but included far more white space, and larger photography to bring attention.</p>
